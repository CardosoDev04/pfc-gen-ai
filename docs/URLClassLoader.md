URLClassLoader is a Java class used to load classes and resources from a set of URLs, which may point to JAR files or directories. By default, it follows the parent delegation model, deferring class loading to its parent ClassLoader before attempting to load the class itself.

In our case, this behavior became problematic because we were dynamically compiling and loading new implementations of a type that the parent classloader had already loaded, specifically classes in the scrapers. package. To ensure our newly compiled implementations were loaded instead of the already-known versions, we created a custom classloader by implementing URLClassLoader and overriding its loadClass method. This override bypasses parent delegation for any class whose name starts with "scrapers.", forcing those classes to be loaded directly from the provided URLs.

We considered passing null as the parent to the URLClassLoader constructor to avoid delegation altogether. However, this approach introduces its own issues: standard library classes were no longer guaranteed to be included in the compilation process and shared types (like IScraper) would no longer be visible unless we manually included them, which is both error-prone and redundant. Retaining a parent classloader ensures shared interfaces and dependencies remain available while still allowing selective override of dynamic implementations.
