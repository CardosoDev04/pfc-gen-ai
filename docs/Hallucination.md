Hallucinations in LLMs refer to the generation of content that is irrelevant, made-up, or inconsistent with the input data. This problem leads to incorrect information, challenging the trust placed in these models. Hallucinations are a critical obstacle in the development of LLMs, often arising from the training data's quality and the models' interpretative limits.
